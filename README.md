# hypergame-theory
setting up a four by four game as a test

Each row is a possible friendly option
Each column is a context
The intersection of an option and a context is a result
results can be text but they should be able to be evaluated using the value scheme chosen.

We look for evidence of contexts.
This can be very diagnostic or not.
